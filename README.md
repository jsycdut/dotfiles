> jalc means jsycdut's arch linux configuration

I'm an arch linux user. This repo contains all my config files, include `vim, tmux and my other configs` aka `dotfiles`, most of them are stored inside of `.config` folder. I've seen lots of instersting configs and I `steal` ideas from them, now it's time to share mine.
